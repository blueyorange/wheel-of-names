# wheel-of-names
A random name selector.

The idea was to use mostly just CSS to turn a simple unordered list into an interactive spinning wheel.

Add names to the list using the input, then click 'spin'.

Fascinating how much you can accomplish with css. The latest trig functions feature enabled the calculations for angles to be done within the css code, greatly simplifying the js. The js then communicates with the css through setting variables.
